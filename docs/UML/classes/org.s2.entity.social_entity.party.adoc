h|*Description*
2+a|An independent entity in the social world, often known as a 'party'. Includes all business, civil, military and legal entities.

A Social entity is either an Agent or a 'Persona' (of an Agent). An intentional  agent can participate in an activity, task, process etc, and make decisions.

Theoretically equivalent to `BFO:Realizable` entity, i.e. an s-dependent continuant whose bearer is some physical entity - e.g. a material person, or an aggregate of persons making up a 'company'.

However, we tend to treat social entities in business and civic life, and hence administratively and legally, as being independent entities that stand for their bearers. Concretely, we don't usually represent the related material entity at all.
